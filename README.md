## Definitions

**Web components** is a collection of native browser features that the W3C is still working on:

ðŸ”¹ Custom elements: Technology responsible for declaring our own elements just like native ones.

ðŸ”¹ Templates: Responsible for declaring the element template.

ðŸ”¹ Shadow DOM: Scoping our elements and not letting CSS and JS overflow out of it.

ðŸ”¹ HTML imports: Importing element declarations from another file.


## BROWSER SUPPORT (The frontend nightmare ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±)

![Image custom elements support](https://github.com/Totemika/i-dont-know-polymer/blob/master/img/browser-support.gif?raw=true)

So, **Chrome** is the only browser giving almost full support to web components.

# Polymer

Polymer aims to solve this problem by providing virtual support for all these features in those browsers where it's not yet supported.

## Source code

The [Polymer source code](http://bit.ly/downloadpolymerjs) is split into three html files allowing the consumer to use three different sizes of the framework.

* micro-polymer
* mini-polymer (referencing micro-polymer)
* polymer (referencing mini-polymer)

It also comes with the web-components library that can also be loaded based on consumer preferences.

Fiddling (playground)
---------------------
In order to save time, the first Polymer exercises will be done on Plunkr. Later, they will be pushed to this repo.

#### 1. Importing Polymer (for practising purposes)

[Plunk](https://plnkr.co/edit/QylLhWU4FAqyDml574NW?p=preview)

* ```rel``` attribute is not supported for all browsers => We use webcomponentslite.mint.js that will work as a fallback shim and allow older browsers to use the rel attribute and load full html documents as well.

* ```<base>``` tag allows modifying the base directory the document will load the reference files from.

* We can (only for playing on plunkr or similar) get all polymer components from the following base: ```<base href="https://polygit.org/components">``` **Note:** It is slow as hell!

#### 2. Hello Element

[Plunk](https://plnkr.co/edit/gWkLtg39GTsJt2hUuq7Q?p=preview)

Creating an element is quite basic. You just have to instantiate a Polymer object, giving a value to the ```is``` property that will act as the component **id**.
Then, use that same id to define the template inside a ```<dom-module></dom-module>``` tag. You can see [the Plunker](https://plnkr.co/edit/gWkLtg39GTsJt2hUuq7Q?p=preview) if it still not clear.


#### 3. Including our Hello Element

[Plunk](https://plnkr.co/edit/fMYgGptFjf2Z4zx6Zkmt?p=preview)

Importing the element is done as a [normal import.](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/)
The ```HTMLImports.whenReady``` used before to instance the element inside the ```<script>``` tags is no longer necessary, as the element will be also an import.
=> If one dependency is already loaded, it won't load it again.
=> **unresolved** attribute hides the tag where it's been declared until all contained elements are loaded. (like the ng-cloak in AngularJS)

Including elements in a separate file is the best practice.

#### 4. Class-style Constructor
With the Polymer function a custom element is defined and registered in only one action. Then, the custom element has to be included in the page HTML. The dom-module was set only for us to add any content for an element.
There is a way where we can set up our custom element's prototype chain but not register it immediately: This is done through the Polymer class function.
```
helloElement = Polymer.Class({
    is: "hello-element",
    created: function() {
        this.textContent = "Hello there";
    }
 });
```
And then we register it as:
```
 document.registerElement('hello-element', HelloElement);
```

Lastly, a new element instance can be created through JavaScript and appended in the body without the need of defining the <hello-element> tag in the body.f

```
var el = new HelloElement();
document.querySelector("body").appendChild(el);
var el2 = document.createElement("hello-element");
document.querySelector("body").appendChild(el2);
```

#### 5. Life-cycle callbacks

[Plunk](https://plnkr.co/edit/ZVNreaVLcerR61S3qGSM?p=preview)

The callback names are very self-explanatory.

* created
* ready
* attached
* detached
* attributeChanged(attrName, oldVal, newVal)
* factoryImpl: **only** called then the element is instantiated using the 'new' key and the Polymer constructor:

```
Element = Polymer ({ is: element-name, factoryImpl ...});
var el = new Element(); // => factoryImpl will be called.

<element-name></element-name> // => factoryImpl will NOT be called.

var el2 = document.createElement("hello-element");
document.querySelector("body").appendChild(el2); // => factoryImpl will NOT be called.
```

#### 6. Extending from a native type

Native types can be extended with the property ```extends``` in the ```Polymer``` constructor definition.

MyExtendedInput = Polymer({
    is: 'my-extended-input',
    extends: 'input',
    ...
});

In order to use the extended element:

Option 1:
```
<input type="text" is="my-extended-input" />
```
Option 2:
```
var el1 = new MyExtendedInput();
document.querySelector("body").appendChild(el1);
```
Option 3:
```
var el2 = document.createElement("input", "my-extended-input");
document.querySelector("body").appendChild(el2);
```

========================

This is the moment I realized Polymer 2.0 is already out. Going to finish this course and go for some Polymer 2.0
