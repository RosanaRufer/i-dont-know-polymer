## Definitions

**Web components** is a collection of native browser features that the W3C is still working on:

ðŸ”¹ Custom elements: Technology responsible for declaring our own elements just like native ones.

ðŸ”¹ Templates: Responsible for declaring the element template.

ðŸ”¹ Shadow DOM: Scoping our elements and not letting CSS and JS overflow out of it.

ðŸ”¹ HTML imports: Importing element declarations from another file.


## BROWSER SUPPORT (The frontend nightmare ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±)

So, **Chrome** is the only browser giving almost full support to web components.

# Polymer

Polymer aims to solve this problem by providing virtual support for all these features in those browsers where it's not yet supported.
